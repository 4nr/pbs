<h1>HTML Block-level Tags Demo</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph, and directly above this you see a top-level heading. Below is a sub-heading.</p>

<h2>This is a sub heading</h2>
<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<h2>List Examples</h2>
<p>Below this paragraph are sub-sub-headings and examples of each type of HTML list:</p>

<h3>A Numbered List (officially called ordered list)</h3>
<ol>
  <li>This is the first element in a numbered list</li>
  <li>This is the second element in a numbered list</li>
  <li>This is the third element in a numbered list</li>
</ol>

<h3>A Bulleted List (officially called unordered list)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This is the first element in a bulleted list</li>
  <li>This is the second element in a bulleted list</li>
  <li>This is the third element in a bulleted list</li>
</ul>

<h3>A Definition List (you could think of it as a dictionary)</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>The First Definition Title</dt>
  <dd>The first definition text - it's not all that interesting!</dd>
  <dt>The Second Definition Title</dt>
  <dd>The second definition text - this is also not that interesting!</dd>
</dl>

<h3>An example of a nested list</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    This top-level bulleted list item contains a numbered list:
    <ol>
      <li>This is the first element in a nested numbered list</li>
      <li>This is the second element in a nested numbered list</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>This is a heading within a bulleted list</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph within a bulleted list, and below this paragraph is a definition list also contained within the same bulleted list item.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>First Definition Title</dt>
      <dd>This is the first definition in a definition list contained within a bulleted list.</dd>
      <dt>Second Definition Title</dt>
      <dd>This is the second definition in a definition list contained within a bulleted list.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>and you could go on and on with more bullets</li>
</ul>

<h2>Block Quote Examples</h2>

<p>Below is a snippet from a poem by the great Irish poet W. B. Yeats, using a header and paragraphs within the block quote, because that is perfectly allowable:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Extract from 'Among School Children'</h3>

  <p>O chestnut tree, great rooted blossomer,<br />
  Are you the leaf, the blossom or the bole?<br />
  O body swayed to music, O brightening glance,<br />
  How can we know the dancer from the dance?</p>

  <p>- W. B. Yeats</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
  <h3>Extract from "Lines Written on a Seat on the Grand Canal, Dublin"</h3>

  <p>O commemorate me where there is water,<br />
  Canal water, preferably, so stilly<br />
  Greeny at the heart of summer. Brother<br />
  Commemorate me thus beautifully<br />
  Where by a lock niagarously roars</p>

  <p>- Patrick Kavanagh</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(notice the use of explicit line-breaks within a paragraph?)</p>
