  <div id="initiailiser">
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>

    <p>When you press the 'start' button below, a new window will pop up
    containing five boxes, a <span class="box box1">red one</span>, a
    <span class="box box2">green one</span>, a
    <span class="box box3">blue one</span>, a <span class="box box4">yellow
    one</span>, and a <span class="box box5">magenta one</span>. The
    <span class="box box1">red</span>, <span class="box box2">green</span>, and
    <span class="box box3">blue</span> boxes are top-level
    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags, added to the HTML document in that order.
    The <span class="box box4">yellow</span> and
    <span class="box box5">magenta</span> boxes are both
    <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tags contained within the
    <span class="box box2">green box</span>, the <span class="box box4">yellow
    one</span> first, then the <span class="box box5">magenta one</span>.</p>

    <p>When you press the <strong>Lets Begin Now</strong> button a control panel will also appear below, allowing you to see and edit the CSS properties for each of the five boxes in the pop-up window. The controls are color-coded to show which box they control. As you change the values in the control panel, the boxes will update appropriately in the pop-up window, and, as you re-size the pop-up window, the values in the control panel will update too.</p>

    <p style="font-style: italic">You will have to allow the pop-up through your
    pop-up blocker for this demo to work.</p>

  <h2>Tip</h2>
  <p>To build the two-column layout with header and footer as shown in the
  demo at the end of <a href="https://www.bartbusschots.ie/s/2016/02/03/programming-by-stealth-8-of-x-css-positioning/" target="_blank">PBS instalment 8</a>,
  take the steps below. <span class="box box1">Box 1</span> will be used at the
  header, <span class="box box2">box 2</span> simply contains the middle parts
  of the page, with <span class="box box4">box 4</span> being the main content,
  and <span class="box box5">box 5</span> becoming the side bar. Finally,
  <span class="box box3">box 3</span> will be the footer.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create some space to move the side-bar into by setting the
      <strong>left margin of <span class="box box4">box 4</span> to
      <code>140px</code></strong>. This value is the sum of the width we will
      set the side-bar to (<code>100px</code>) and twice the <code>20px</code>
      margins in use around all the boxes.</li>
    <li><strong>Set the width of <span class="box box5">box 5</span> to
      <code>100px</code>.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Set the position of <span class="box box5">box 5</span> to
      <code>absolute</code></strong>. Notice that it has now been pulled out
      of the normal flow of the document, causing <span class="box box2">box
      2</span> to shrink, and hence <span class="box box3">box 3</span> to move
      up.</li>
    <li><strong>Set the top and left of <span class="box box5">box 5</span> to
      <code>0px</code></strong>. Because this box is not contained within
      any <em>positioned</em> boxes, its position has been calculated relative
      to the body of the page. Because it has a 20 pixel margin, the visible
      part of the box now appears 20 pixels down from the top of the body, and
      20 pixels in from its left - over <span class="box box1">box 1</span>.</li>
    <li>To make the positioning of the sidebar (<span class="box box5">box
      5</span>) be relative to the central region (<span class="box box2">box
      2</span>), we need to turn that box into a <em>positioned</em> box by
      setting its <code>position</code> to something other than
      <code>static</code> that will not pull it out of the normal flow, nor
      alter its placement within the document - <strong>set the position of
      <span class="box box2">box 2</span> to <code>relative</code></strong></li>
  </ol>
